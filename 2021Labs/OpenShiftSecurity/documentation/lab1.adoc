== Lab 1: OpenShift blocks 'rogue' containers from running as privileged user


=== Goal of Lab 1
The goal of this Lab is to learn about the default security technologies in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Specifically, you will see how OpenShift blocks 'rogue' containers with images from from Docker Hub from running as a privileged root user and how you can work around that restrictions for this specific container.

=== Introduction

Almost all software you are running in your containers does not require 'root' level access. Your web applications, databases, load balancers, number crunchers, etc. do not need to be run as 'root' ever. Building container images that do not require 'root' at all and basing images off of non-privileged container images are needed for container security. However, the vast majority of container images in the world today, such as the community container images available on Docker Hub, require 'root' user. By default, no containers are allowed to run as 'root' on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. An admin can override this, otherwise all user containers run without ever becoming 'root'. This is particularly important in multi-tenant OpenShift Kubernetes clusters, where a single cluster may be serving multiple applications and multiple development teams. It is not always practical or even advisable for administrators to run separate clusters for each.

=== Lab 1.1 Pull 'rogue' container image from Docker Hub and observe how OpenShift locks down the container by default


. Create a new project called *userX-myproject* (or any other name that you prefer).

+
[source]
----
oc new-project userX-myproject
----

. In the OpenShift console, switch to *Developer* prespective from Adminstrator in left upper corner, click on *+Add* menu item.
+

. Then, click on *Container Images* . Make sure that *Image name from external registry* is selected and for the Image Name, type *docker.io/httpd*. Press the magnifying glass.
+
image:images/lab1.1-4.7.33-image-external.png[]

  NOTE: Notice that this container image requires to be run as 'root' and listen on port 80.
  
. Leave other values as defaults and press *Create*.

. Now, go back to your terminal and navigate into the project you just created by typing *oc project myproject*. Then, take a look at your pods by typing *oc get pods*. Notice that one of your pods has a CrashLoopBackOff error.
+
image:images/lab1.1-crashloopbackofferror.png[]

. Let's investigate further what is causing this error. Take a look at the log of the pod that is causing this error.
You can get the name of the pod from the previous *oc get pods* command.
+
[source]
----
POD=`oc get pods --selector app=httpd -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name --no-headers`; oc logs $POD
# Or use the following command manually replacing the pod_name with the name of your pod.
# oc logs <pod_name i.e httpd-f958ccb88-r5542>
----

. Notice that you get permission denied errors saying that you cannot bind to port 80. This is because the proccess was not startup as root and was modified by the security context constraint to run as a specific user. 

+
image:images/lab1.1-noport80.png[1500,1500]

. Also we can review failing container logs via OpenShift UI console, Log tab for that pod:
+
image:images/lab1.1-failingpod-log.png[]


. For a more detailed look, type 'oc describe pod ....' with the name of your pod.

+
[source]
----
oc describe pod $pod
# Or 
# oc describe pod <insert_pod_name i.e httpd-f958ccb88-r5542>
----
+
image:images/lab1.1-describepod-error.png[]

. Notice that the output shows that the container failed after trying to start on port 80 and terminated due to a CrashLoopBackOff error. Also notice the default OpenShift Security Context Constraints (SCC) policy that is in place is 'restricted' (openshift.io/scc: restricted).

. Finally, investigate your pod yaml in the OpenShift console by navigating to the *YAML** view of your pod in the OpenShift console. Scroll down to the containers definition and notice how the SCC has dropped several capabilites and added a specifc runAsUser. These modifications have prevented your pod from scheduling because it was originally designed in an insecure state.

=== Lab 1.2 Work around the default container security restriction by using service accounts with SCC privileges

. Now let's resolve this issue. In order to allow containers to run with elevated SCC privileges, we will create a Service Account (a special user account to run services) called 'privileged-sa':
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ oc create sa privileged-sa
serviceaccount/privileged-sa created
----

. Then, we will entitle that Service Account (which is not used by default by any pods) to run as any userId by running the folowing command to add an SCC context:
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z privileged-sa
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:openshift:scc:anyuid added: "privileged-sa"
----

. Now we have a Service Account that can run pods/containers using any userId. But how can we "plug" it into out application to allow it to run with that privilege? There is a pretty straighforward OpenShift command for that as well that "injects" that non-default service account into our application deployment:
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ oc set serviceaccount  deployment httpd privileged-sa
deployment.apps/httpd serviceaccount updated
----
. That will make our 'httpd' pod use this Service Account and enable elevated privileges. We can verify that our Deployment now is using that Service Account by running command:
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ oc describe deployment httpd

=== Summary

So you have learned that OpenShift by default blocks containers that need to run with elevated privileges. Also, by adding SCC privileges to a Service Account and using that Service Account to run a pod that requires elevated privileges, you can get it to run securely on OpenShift. Please keep in mind that best approach is to always assign minimal SCC privileges that are required for pod security to such service accounts. 

Per OpenShift Documentation (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/security/container_security/security-hosts-vms.html) the best practice is for most containers, except those managing or monitoring the host system itself, to run as a non-root user. Dropping the privilege level or creating containers with the *least amount of privileges possible* is recommended best practice for protecting your own OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
